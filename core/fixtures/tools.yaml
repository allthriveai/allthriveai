    tagline: Build stateful, multi-actor AI agents with full control
    description: >
      Low-level framework from LangChain for building stateful, agentic applications.
      Define agents as graphs with nodes (functions) and edges (transitions), enabling
      complex multi-step workflows with branching logic, cycles, and human-in-the-loop.
      Built on top of LangChain with full control over agent behavior. Supports persistence,
      streaming, time travel debugging, and deployment via LangGraph Cloud. Open source;
      cloud hosting available through LangSmith.
