        <h2>What Makes AllThrive AI Different?</h2>

        <h3>LLM-Discoverable by Design</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional portfolio sites, AllThrive AI is optimized for discovery by
            Large Language Models like ChatGPT and Claude. When someone asks "show me AI
            chatbot examples" or "best AI portfolio platforms," your AllThrive projects
            can appear in the response.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Through Play</h3>
        <p>
            We've gamified the learning experience with:
        </p>

            <li><strong>Side Quests</strong> - Complete challenges to earn XP and achievements</li>
            <li><strong>Battles</strong> - Compete in prompt engineering challenges</li>
